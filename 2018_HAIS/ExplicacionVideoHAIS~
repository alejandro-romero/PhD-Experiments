This process starts by obtaining relatively simple Separable Utility Regions
(SURs) which allow the system to consistently achieve goals, although not nec-
essarily in the most efficient manner (Explicar en base al video).

The system tended to move in straight lines reducing the distance to one of its sensors.
The point is that it not able to reach the goal in a direct way, as it follows SURs.

The traces obtained by these SURs are then used to provide training data for a neural network based value function. => Re-description process

After the re-description process the traces obtained they take the robot directly to the goal whatever its initial position on the stage.

All in all, it has been possible to see the improvement in system efficiency when solving the task, derived from the two-step re-description process.

This process involves first generating a SUR based representation of the utility model that is quite simple to obtain and only requires determining the correlations between the appropriate directions in state space
and the values of the sensors. These correlations allow the robot to consistently reach
the goal, albeit not in the most efficient or direct way. As a second step, the information
derived from the traces obtained through the SUR model are used in order to efficiently
train a neural network that progressively provides a much more efficient utility function
representation.
